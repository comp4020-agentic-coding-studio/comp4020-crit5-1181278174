// Screenshots at both marking viewports: `pnpm shot`.
//
// Windows Chrome cannot do this. `chrome.exe --headless --window-size=390,844`
// lays the page out at clientWidth = 526 and crops the PNG to 390 — the file has
// the size you asked for and a layout you did not, which reads as a CSS bug and
// is not one (see CLAUDE.md, "Facts about this repo that bite"). A Linux
// Chromium has no window manager to clamp it and lays out at exactly 390.
//
// The binary is Playwright's cached `chrome-headless-shell`, with three shared
// libraries fetched unprivileged into ~/chromium-libs. Machine-local, so this
// script says so plainly rather than failing with a loader error.
//
// EVERY run verifies the viewport before it trusts a PNG: a probe page prints
// `document.documentElement.clientWidth`, and `--dump-dom` reads it back. A
// screenshot whose layout width is not the width claimed is not evidence, and
// the whole reason this file exists is that one silently was.
